### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a passionate mobile app/software engineer from Japan based in the United States. 

I enjoy playing Super Smash Bros Ultimate during my free time, and for the next couple of months, I will participate in competitive landscape of the game.

PianoðŸŽ¹ is one of the things that identify me. It's been there for me since I was 5 years old, and now, it's almost a part of my life.
